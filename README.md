Contains code for emotional memory tasks programmed mostly in Python/PsycoPy

"LFM2_day2.py" is the code for the recall task on day 2 of the Axolotl-MemoryLab task, where they are asked to recall whether they have seen the image on the screen (as one they have seen on the previous day). This is adapted straight from Frankie Reyna's PTSD Day 2 PsycoPy program.
